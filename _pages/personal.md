Welcome to my personal page, where I gather cherished memories shared with family and friends. From a young age, I've been incredibly fortunate to travel extensively, thanks to my participation in international mathematics competitions. These experiences ignited a lifelong passion for exploring the world. Curious to see where I've been? Check out my travel adventures [here](https://ploynawapan.github.io/year-archive/).

In addition to my love for travel, I'm also passionate about oil painting and photography. These artistic pursuits allow me to express myself creatively. Feel free to check out my artwork and photography portfolio [here](https://ploynawapan.github.io/portfolio/).
