Welcome to my personal page, where I gather cherished memories shared with family and friends. From a young age, I've been incredibly fortunate to travel extensively. These experiences ignited a lifelong passion for exploring the world. If you are interested in where I have been, you can check out my travel adventures [here](https://ploynawapan.github.io/travel/). 

In addition to my love for travel, I'm also passionate about oil painting and photography. Feel free to check out my artwork and photography portfolio [here](https://ploynawapan.github.io/portfolio/).
