Upon my graduation from Bowdoin College in Maine, I have presented my honors thesis to the mathematics department. The topic is mainly about two families of L-functions, namely, the Dirichlet L-functions and the L-functions of cups forms. The first family is where the Riemann zeta function, our favourite L-function belong to. The second one is a little more special as we have to acquire some knowledge about modular forms in order to understand this kind of L-functions.

**Abstract**
------

In \cite{ciaurri}, the authors introduced a simple proof of Euler's formula for $\zeta(2k)$ and slightly modified the proof to derive an integral representation for $\zeta(2k+1)$, where $k$ is any positive integer. In this paper, by adapting their ideas, we present a new proof for evaluating the special values of the Dirichlet beta function, $\beta(2k+1)$. Our approach relies on some properties of the Euler numbers and polynomials, and uses basic calculus and telescoping series. By a similar procedure, we also yield an integral representation of $\beta(2k)$.

I have created this {% include base_path %}[slides](http://ploynawapan.github.io/files/Honorsthesis_Ploy.pdf) to accompany my honors thesis presentation at the end of my senior year. I did have to present it at the end of the first semester as well, but at that time, my study was still half way done, so I don't think the slides I used then would be as helpful and informative as this one. Feel free to check it out, but please do not use it without citing.

Moreover, here is the [thesis](https://digitalcommons.bowdoin.edu/honorsprojects/266/) that I wrote upon graduation. It is on the Bowdoin Digital Commons website. Non-Bowdoin students should be able to access the file in May 2022, but for my Bowdoin fellows, it should be now available for you all.

All the professors at Bowdoin College who had helped me throughout the process of make this happened, especially, Professor Naomi Tanabe who is such a wonderful advisor and mentor to me.
