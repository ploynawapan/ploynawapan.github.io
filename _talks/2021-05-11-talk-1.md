Upon my graduation from Bowdoin College in Maine, I have presented my honors thesis to the mathematics department. The topic is mainly about two families of L-functions, namely, the Dirichlet L-functions and the L-functions of cups forms. The first family is where the Riemann zeta function, our favourite L-function belong to. The second one is a little more special as we have to acquire some knowledge about modular forms and cusp forms in order to understand the L-functions associated with cusp forms.
