Most of them are merely summaries of some topics I am interested in, but I think they might be helpful, so I wanted to share them. These final papers are for rings theory, advanced topic in geometry, and algebraic geometry.

Rings Theory
======

*A Short Introduction to Rings of Integers*: this paper is for Professor Naomi Tanabe's MATH2702. 

Abstract
---
This paper presents a brief introduction to rings of integers, starting from the definitions and fundamental properties of algebraic numbers and algebraic integers. Then, we provide some examples of rings of integers including rings of integers of a cyclotomic number field and rings of quadratic integers. Lastly, we show how the knowledge in this topic can be applied to solving interesting mathematics problems.

Advanced Topics in Geometry
======

*Hyperbolic Trigonometry: Development, Identities, and Applications*: this paper is for Professor Jennifer Taback's MATH3404. 

Abstract
---
While the study of trigonometry stemmed from the investigation of triangles in the past, the development of "hyperbolic" trigonometry is different and interesting. This paper summarizes the history of hyperbolic trigonometry and presents several remarkable hyperbolic trigonometry identities that have nice Euclidean counterparts. Lastly, we provide a couple of applications to emphasize the importance of this topic that is not limited to theoretical mathematics.

Algebraic Geometry
======

*Rational equivalence and variety isomorphism*: this paper is for Professor Thomas Pietraho's MATH3702. 

Abstract
---
This paper is a continuation of what we have learned in
MATH 3702, Algebraic Geometry. This work closely follows Chapter 5 of \cite{Ideal} while the first four chapters of the book have already been covered in class. In this paper, we want to explore the notion of variety isomorphism, meaning to understand when two varieties are ''the same.'' The first three sections lay down the necessary background. Section 4 then gives us a method to determine variety isomorphism through the isomorphism of their coordinate rings, while Section 5 offers another way using the rational equivalence of their function fields.
