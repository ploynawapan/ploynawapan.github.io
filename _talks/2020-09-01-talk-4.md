**Abstract**
------

An interesting question known as the Gaussian moat problem asks whether it is possible to walk to infinity on the Gaussian primes with a bounded step size. 
Our work examine a similar situation in the real quadratic integer ring Z[sqrt2] whose primes mostly cluster along the asymptotes $y = \pm x/\sqrt{2}$ as compared
to the Gaussian primes, which congregate only at the origin. We construct a probabilistic model of primes in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$ by applying the prime number
theorem and a combinatorial theorem for counting the number of lattice points whose absolute values of their norms are no greater than $n^2$. 
We then use the model to prove that it is impossible to walk to infinity if the walk remains within some bounded distance from the asymptotes. 
Lastly, we perform a few moat calculations to show that the longest walk is likely to stay close to the asymptotes; 
hence, we conjecture that there is no walk to infinity in this case.
