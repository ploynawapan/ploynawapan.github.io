This work is a spin-off from the paper "Walking to Infinity Along Some Number Theory sequences." However, instead of observing sequences of integers which is one-dimensional, we consider primes in the real quadratic integer rings in Z\[√2\] which are of the form a+b\sqrt√2. This study was inspired by the Gaussian Moat problem posed by Basil Gordon in 1962, and the work has been presented in a couple of conferences by my collegue, Bencheng Li and Daniel Sarnecki. 

**Abstract**
------

An interesting question known as the Gaussian moat problem asks whether it is possible to walk to infinity on the Gaussian primes with a bounded step size. Our work examine a similar situation in the real quadratic integer ring Z\[√2\] whose primes mostly cluster along the asymptotes y = x/√2 and y = -x/√2 as compared to the Gaussian primes, which congregate only at the origin. We construct a probabilistic model of primes in Z\[√2\] by applying the prime number theorem and a combinatorial theorem for counting the number of lattice points whose absolute values of their norms are no greater than n^2. We then use the model to prove that it is impossible to walk to infinity if the walk remains within some bounded distance from the asymptotes. Lastly, we perform a few moat calculations to show that the longest walk is likely to stay close to the asymptotes; hence, we conjecture that there is no walk to infinity in this case.
