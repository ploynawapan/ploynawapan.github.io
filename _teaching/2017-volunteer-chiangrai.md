My friends and I have thought a lot about how Thai education is greatly impacted by unequal distribution of resources, opportunities, and living standards across different regions. While most of us live in the capital of our provinces, there are a lot of students who live in rural and almost inaccessible areas. We then decided to volunteer as teachers during the summer of 2017. The organization whom we partnered with was Kroo-Ban-Nok, which has been known to help thousands and thousands of students over decades.

We went to the school called "Rong Rien Wat Huai Hin Laad Nai (Wat Huai Hin Laad Nai school)." The school is uphill in a rural area in Chiang Rai. I went with Um-im, Nita, Net, Natee, Armor, Purim, and Smile. Luckily, Um-im and Smile are in the area, so we could stay with them and travel in the city for a bit before teaching the kids. Note that the kids we taught are a minority group in Thailand, or what Thai people call "Pakakayor ปะกากญอ." They know Thai but cannot communicate that well.

We rode a truck up the hill and got stuck from time to time because of the muddy road. When we finally arrived at the village, we were taken to the houses we would spend four nights at. The program was only five days, but we planned many things to do with the kids. We made several English games and art projects so that the kids could enjoy the subjects while gaining more knowledge. We could easily notice that they did not want to learn to get a high degree or leave the village. They just wanted to know enough so that they can survive in the Thai community down there. However, we did try our best to teach them, in case that one day they might want to go to the city and make a living there.

While I said that we were there to teach the kids, they also taught us things we had never done before. We got to learn how to plant rice and to take care of small and annoying kids. We also got to join their celebration at night and eat some local desserts with the adults there. There were only a few TV there, so we saw people gather at a house to watch TV together every night. Their food was basic and sometimes did not have enough nutrition. While we were served rice and omelet and canned fish menus, I could imagine that they might have to eat something not as good on their normal days. I had to tell you that we paid about $20-30 for the food and housing, which sounded unfair because we went there to help them. But, well, life was even more unfair with the people upthere.

It was great five days of my life, and I wish I could return to see the kids. I couldn't remember all of the kids' names because it has been so long, but I remember Fino, Ao, and Tangmo. For the rest, if I see them, I believe I'll recognize them easily. The kids told me they would seek me when they grow up. That was very sweet of them, although I know that wasn't easy. I only hope that they grow up to be kind and intelligent adults to have the happier life they dream for.
