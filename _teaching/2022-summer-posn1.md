excerpt: <img src='/images/ba1.png' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> When I first arrived in the US, all my Thai scholar friends and I had to go to a summer program in New Hampshire at Brewster Academy. There, we got to learn several English skills and survival skills, including communication, essay writing, public speaking, SAT, and also American history. The camp was meant to help us adjust to the American culture and prepare us for life in prep school. We could not be more greatful about the program. Then, for two years after in summer 2018, I went back to the program to be a TA for another Thai scholar generation, TS 61 (Thai Scholars Buddist year 2561).
