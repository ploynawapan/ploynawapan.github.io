excerpt: <img src='/images/sit2.png' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> While I was attending Holderness school to repeat my senior high school year, I had to attend the winter program prepared for Thai scholars. I was there with all the Thai scholars in my year to write a personal statement and several other essays to apply for colleges. In 2019, two year afterward, I went to the program again but as a proofreader for the next generation kids. Here are some quick links to the presentations about how to list [honors/awards](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sVsCDP0ytKitZeydRZ-xPFvhKVrYbLXr/view?usp=sharing) and [activities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bgMDyHT-XqA90M6zHmGellevF_4O46dI/view?usp=sharing) in the Commonapp.
