excerpt: <img src='/images/sit2.png' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> After graduating from Mahidol Wittayanusor high school in Nakorn Pathom, my roommate, my neighbor Stang, and I decided to go on a trip together. That coincided when my parent just bought a new house in my hometown, Ubon Ratchathani.  We thus decided to gather at my hometown and go to Laos, which is two hours from Ubon Ratchathani. Thanks to several sponsors (i.e., Pleng, Prim's, and my parents), we had a perfect time staying in my hometown and Savannakhet, Laos.
