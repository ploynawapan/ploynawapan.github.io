In Spring 2018 when I was a first year student at Bowdoin College, I had an opportunity to take the class 'Japanese Sci-Fi and Mystery.' This is the project that I did with my friend Emma. We created a magazine that talks about the world in 50 years from now. There are a bunch of interesting predictions in the magazine, so check it out through this link: [*The world to come*](http://ploynawapan.github.io/files/The_World_to_Come2.pdf).
