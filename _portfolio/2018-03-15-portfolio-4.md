title: "The world to come"
excerpt: <img src='/images/World.png' width='200' height='150' align="right" hspace="20"> In Spring 2018 when I was a first year student at Bowdoin College, I had an opportunity to take the class 'Japanese Sci-Fi and Mystery' with Professor Born. The class was so much fun since we got to read many interesting books (one of them was Rampo's short stories.) For the final, I did this project with my friend Emma. We created a magazine that talks about the world in 50 years from now. There are a bunch of interesting predictions in the magazine, so check it out!

In Spring 2018 when I was a first year student at Bowdoin College, I had an opportunity to take the class 'Japanese Sci-Fi and Mystery.' This is the project that I did with my friend Emma. We created a magazine that talks about the world in 50 years from now. There are a bunch of interesting predictions in the magazine, so check it out through this link: [*The world to come*](ploynawapan.github.io/files/The_World_to_Come 2.pdf).
