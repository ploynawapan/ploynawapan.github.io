excerpt: <img src='/images/cook book.png' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> A fun project that I did during summer 2021 was that I collected all the recipes of menus I craved! I got the recipes from many websites and youtube channels, which I am very thankful for. Here is the link to [Ploy's cook book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I5gjOraxSstBxdUlQM-y1t1blBar-wM8/view?usp=sharing). Please note that none of these is my own recipes, and most of the korean recipes are from the Jihyunkkung channel on YouTube.

A fun project that I did during summer 2021 was that I collected all the recipes of menus I craved! I got the recipes from many websites and youtube channels, which I am very thankful for. Here is the link to [Ploy's cook book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I5gjOraxSstBxdUlQM-y1t1blBar-wM8/view?usp=sharing). Please bear in mind that none of these is my idea, and most of the korean recipes are from Jihyunkkung.

Here is a preview of what my cook book looks like! The pictures will soon be replaced with the pictures of food I make on my own. (Now, let's appreciate the beautiful picture I got from the internet.)

Some of the menus I got the ideas from Lauren, Yichun, David, Tarang, Maria, and Peem: my friends at Ploy's Konyha (Kitchen in Hungarian). Thank you all!
