title: "Little Red Riding Hood"
excerpt: <img src='/images/L1.jpg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> This was the second project of Photography 1, and the theme was pretty strange. Our professor showed us a bunch of photos that seemed surreal and told us to create something along that line. I then decided to recreate the famous European fairy tale 'Little Red Riding Hood.' I'm very thankful for my friend Emma who was willing to be the model for this project. The main techniques I exploited in this project were double exposure and shadows. Warning! My story telling is going to be different from the original one...
