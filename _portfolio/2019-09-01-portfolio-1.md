title: "Composition and Long Exposure"
excerpt: <img src='/images/E1.JPG' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> This was the very first project in Photography 1 at Bowdoin College. I took this class in my junior undergrad, and all I learned were techniques in film photography. We learned how to shoot, take a roll of film out of the camera, develop the film, and transfer photos onto the photography papers. This first assignment was to explore the basic knowledge in photography, namely, composition and long exposure.
