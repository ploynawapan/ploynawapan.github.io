title: "Creative Writing"
excerpt: <img src='/images/sonnet.png' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> With the scholarship from the Thai government I received in 2016 (right after highschool), I got the privilege to repeat my senior year at the Holderness school in NH. One of the classes I took there is creative writing with Ms. Dahl. That was my first and only time I took creative writing. It was fun but also challenging for a Thai student whose English was not so good like me. However, I enjoyed it so much, and here is the collection of poems and short stories I wrote for the class.
