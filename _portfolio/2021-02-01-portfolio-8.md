title: "My Bakery House"
excerpt: <img src='/images/bakery.jpg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20">  Bakery! My mom and I have started exploring the theory of baking for years, but I haven't got so far compared to my mom, who bakes like 5 times a week. Still, I love baking andtrying new recipes. I feel like baking is like a little science experiment, but much easier and more fun. Here are just some recipes that worked so far, so I want to keep a record so that I can come back and bake them again!
