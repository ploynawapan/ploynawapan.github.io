"Missed calls" was the final project for my Photography 1. The semester was actually one of the hardest one during my time at Bowdoin since I was taking 5 classes and two of them were project-based. (YES, this class was one of them.) Anyway, for this one, we were assigned to create something we cannot see. Hence, I decided to create the *images* of mobile's ringtones. The actual project had the selected ringtones attached to each picture, but here I just want to present the photos and the techniques I incorporated.
