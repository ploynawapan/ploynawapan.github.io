excerpt: <img src='/images/Cat0.JPG' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> When I got back home in summer 2021 after graduated from Bowdoin, I needed to quarantine myself in a hotel room for 14 days. My friend Um-im suggested me draw a short comic, so I came up with this comic which is all about my cat, Meow.I used the free trial of a comic drawing application on my ipad, so when the period ended, I didn't continue drawing or anything. Plus, I had quite a lot to do outside of a hotel room. Anyway, drawing cats was a really fun experience!
