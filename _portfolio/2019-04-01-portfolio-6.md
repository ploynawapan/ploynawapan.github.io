Japanese language has become part of my identity since I entered Bowdoin College in 2017. My friend Poy recommended me to take Japanese, and I never regret my decision. Japanese was so much fun, and the Japanese community at Bowdoin has become my comfort zone. One thing that Japanese students have to do at the end of each semester is to create a skit in Japanese! Here are the skits I was involved in.

* {% include base_path %} [*1st year Spring skit*](https://youtu.be/oV4kzZhUE60).
* {% include base_path %} [*3st year Fall skit*](https://youtu.be/UmTJgURJmZQ).

(Unfortunately, I don't have the links to my two other skit that I was involved during my Sophomore, but I hope these three video make your day!)
