title: "Following the Fall Colors Through Four National Parks"
excerpt: <img src='/images/SC/SC1.jpeg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20" loading="lazy"> Foliage season feels so fleeting to me, so Poy and I never really planned to chase fall colors anywhere beyond our university campus. But there are a few national parks that are especially beautiful in autumn, and we wanted to try visiting them at their peak. We followed the fall–color predictions closely and booked our flights well in advance to keep costs down. On this trip, we were lucky enough to catch vibrant red and yellow leaves in Shenandoah, New River Gorge, and Great Smoky Mountains National Parks. We also had the chance to explore the beautiful wetlands of Congaree National Park before flying back home!

Our foliage trip began on October 24, when we flew from Champaign to Washington, DC. We arrived at Reagan National Airport (DCA) quite late at night, so after picking up our rental car we drove straight to Days Inn in Alexandria, a convenient and no-frills stop not far from the airport—perfect for a quick rest before the real adventure.

**Shenandoah National Park**

The trip truly began on the morning of October 25. We left early for Shenandoah National Park and arrived around 8:30 a.m., just as the park was waking up. During our visit, a government shutdown was in effect, so most visitor centers were closed—but thankfully, the trails and scenery were still fully accessible.

We hiked for about two hours along the trail to Dark Hollow Falls, one of Shenandoah’s most popular and accessible waterfalls. The trees were mostly golden yellow, with some already past peak, but the air was crisp and the atmosphere incredibly refreshing. Even without full fall colors, the quiet forest and the sound of water tumbling over rocks made the hike deeply calming.

Afterward, we continued along Skyline Drive, Shenandoah’s iconic scenic road that runs the length of the park. The winding drive offered beautiful views of rolling ridges layered with autumn colors—perfect for soaking in the season at a relaxed pace.

For lunch, we stopped at Edelweiss German Restaurant, a cozy, old-fashioned spot that felt wonderfully homey. We enjoyed pork schnitzel and goulash, finishing with a not-too-sweet Black Forest cake. Everything was comforting and delicious—exactly what we needed before getting back on the road.

**New River Gorge National Park**

Recharged, we headed toward our second national park: New River Gorge National Park in West Virginia. Our first stop was the park’s most iconic landmark, the New River Gorge Bridge, which was framed beautifully by forests glowing in fall colors. The contrast between the massive steel bridge and the soft autumn landscape was striking.

We then decided to hike part of the Endless Wall Trail, one of the park’s most scenic paths. The hike took about an hour each way and rewarded us with stunning views of the canyon below, where the river wound quietly beneath cliffs lined with brilliantly colored trees. By the time we returned to the parking lot, the sun had set—nature’s clear signal that it was time to rest. We spent the night near Beckley, not far from the park.

**Great Smoky Mountains National Park** 

On October 26, we continued south to Great Smoky Mountains National Park. It took a while to reach Pigeon Forge, a small but lively town just outside the park known for its restaurants and attractions. By the time we arrived, it was nearly noon, so we stopped for lunch at Bullfish Grill. We shared a huge plate of seafood gumbo and seared trout—filling and flavorful, though we couldn’t help comparing it to the trout we once had in Stanley.

After lunch, we made a quick stop at The Old Mill, a charming historic area with shops selling food, crafts, and souvenirs. We treated ourselves to fall-inspired ice cream—pumpkin and caramel—which felt like the perfect seasonal indulgence.

In the afternoon, we explored the Smokies themselves. Despite the park’s vast size, there was quite a bit of traffic, as many visitors pulled into overlooks to photograph the foliage. Progress was slow, but understandable—every turn revealed another postcard-worthy view. We stopped at one of the designated viewpoints to take in the colorful landscape before continuing to Kuwohi (formerly Clingmans Dome), the highest point in the park.

We had hoped for sweeping views from the observation tower, but heavy fog rolled in by the time we reached the base. With visibility nearly zero, we decided to skip the climb. Still, the misty walk back down had its own quiet charm. We finished the day with a scenic drive out of the park and checked into Brookstone Lodge in Asheville, a comfortable place to unwind after a long day.

**Congaree National Park**

On the final day of our trip, October 27, we spent the morning at Congaree National Park before our evening flight. It was a rainy morning, which only added to the park’s serene atmosphere. We began at the Harry Hampton Visitor Center, then set out for a gentle walk through the forest.

Congaree is refreshingly easy to navigate, and at the time only one main trail was open: the Boardwalk Loop Trail. This elevated wooden walkway winds through a floodplain forest known for its towering trees, some of the tallest in the eastern United States. Everything was lush, green, and glistening from the rain. The park felt calm and almost meditative, with very few people around. The walk took about an hour and a half and was flat, easy, and accessible.

Afterward, we headed to Charlotte Douglas International Airport and flew back to Chicago, bringing our foliage trip to a close. It was a journey filled with changing landscapes, cozy meals, misty mountains, and quiet walks—truly a wonderful way to experience autumn together.
