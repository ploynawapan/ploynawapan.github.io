title: "Small trips around Champaign"
excerpt: <img src='/images/St-0.JPG' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20">  Champaign is often thought of a cornfield city and nothing else. I have to admit that the statement is partially correct. However, there are several things to do if you are willing to drive a couple of hours. During Spring 2024, Poy and I made several small trips to our neighborhood cities, including, Indianapolis and St. Louis. We also want to record here a small trip to see one of the most amazing natural pheonomena, the total solar eclipse.
