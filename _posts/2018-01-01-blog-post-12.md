Around the new year eve 2018, my parents, my brother, my grandmather, and I went to Malaysia to escape from the noisy celebration in our hometown. The purpose of this trip was not nothing much but the desire to explore our neighbor country. Malaysia is right below Thailand, and we have a direct flight from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur, so it was an easy trip for my grandmother. We spent around 3-4 days in Malaysia just to see what the country looked like. To my surprise, Malaysia is such a good blend of nature and people's faith.

We noticed a lot of mosques as the bus passed by, but we actually went down the bus and visited only two of them. I don't remember what the exact names of these two mosques, but the guide told us that these are the blue mosque and the pink mosque, which was not surprising. For the blue one, we did have a chance to change our cloth to the one you see in the picture (that was my grandma and she looked just like the Casper ghost). We went inside to see the architecture of the mosque. It was actually pretty breezy and serene inside.
