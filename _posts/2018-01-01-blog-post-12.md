Around the new year eve 2018, my parents, my brother, my grandmather, and I went to Malaysia to escape from the noisy celebration in our hometown. The purpose of this trip was not nothing much but the desire to explore our neighbor country. Malaysia is right below Thailand, and we had a direct flight from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur, so it was easy enough for my grandmother. We spent around 3-4 days in Malaysia just to see what the country was like. To my surprise, Malaysia was such a good blend of nature and people's faith.

We noticed a lot of mosques as the bus passed by, but we actually went down the bus and visited only two of them. I don't remember what the exact names of these two mosques, but the guide told us that these are the blue mosque and the pink mosque, which was not surprising. For the blue one, we did have a chance to change our cloth to the one you see in the picture (that was my grandma and she looked just like the Casper ghost). We went inside to see the architecture of the mosque. It was actually pretty breezy and serene inside.

The next one that we went to is the Batu caves which are 12 km to the north of Kuala Lumpur. The huge golden statue that you see in the picture is Lord Murugan. We were excited to climb up the stairs and see what was inside the caves. I knew that the place was constructed by Hindus, but I didn't know much about the religion, so I couldn't tell you much of the story of the caves. However, the caves were really beautiful and it was perfectly blended with the nature inside the caves. When we reached to the heart of the caves where all the important statues are, we could see the sunlight shining on the statues through the natural hole of the caves. Well, I wish my grandmother could go inside with us, but she didn't want to risk her knees and was sitting outside enjoying fresh coconut water.

There were actually many place in the capital that we went to, but all I could recall were these two places: the Royal Palace Istana Negara and the Petronas Towers. For the palace, we didn't go inside (more like we couldn't go inside for some security reason), but the palace was surely huge. We could observe a couple of soldier marching and riding a horse which was interesting! Then, we went to the Petronas tower, the twin towers that I had seen for so long on the documentary and news. I wasn't quite elegant as I thought, and partly because it was already 2018, when there were thousands of skyscappers that are much taller than it.

The buildings/town aspects of Malaysia was not as touching as its nature. I actually enjoyed the beautiful sceneries of Malaysia's highlands much more. There were two highlands that we went to: the Cameron highlands and the Genting highlands. The cameron highlands are famous of their tea and flowers. We were forutnate enough that it wasn't pouring on the day we went to sea the tea plantation on the hills and the laverder gardens. My Brother, P, seemed to enjoy taking pictures of the flowers and tea field so much!

The second highlands we went to is the Genting highlands which we had to ride on the cable car up to the hills. We stayed in the huge hotel on the hills and had a dinner at Din Tai Fung, a Chinese dimsum restaurant. There were many entertainments up there, including casino and movie theater. We didn't do any of those, but kinda enjoyed ourselves in our comfortable rooms.

Well, I would say Malaysia is not the best place I have been to, but it did give me a refreshing moment from the school. I love the nature of Malaysia. Although the climate there is a lot like that of Thailand, all the highlands did give a different vibe which I like. I would totally recommend you to visit Malaysia once. It's very affordable and beautiful.
