title: "First trip of 2025: Seattle!"
excerpt: <img src='/images/seattle/sea0.jpeg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> We started this year by traveling to Seattle as part of the JMM conference. Although we have been to Seattle before, but we only visited national parks here not the city itself (despite the fact that we flew to SEA-TAC airport). For this reason, while I was attending the conference, we then also spent a little bit of our free time exploring this lovely city together. To our surprise, we could fit so many attractions in this business trip. The city was so charming and, more importantly, walkable!
