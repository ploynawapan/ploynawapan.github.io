We’ve been to Florida together before, but last time we stayed in Orlando and visited Disney World. Now that we've started exploring more national parks, we decided to return to Florida with the goal of visiting all three national parks in the state: Everglades, Biscayne, and Dry Tortugas. Except for Everglades, the other two are only accessible by ferry or speedboat, which gave us some unique experiences we hadn’t had anywhere else in the U.S.

On March 15, the first day of our spring break, we began our trip by taking the Peoria bus to O’Hare and then catching a flight to Miami—a journey that took nearly the entire day. After arriving in Miami, we picked up a rental car and drove to our Airbnb in Homestead. We chose to stay in Homestead because it’s conveniently located near all the national parks we planned to visit (except for Dry Tortugas, which is in Key West). Exhausted but excited for the days ahead, we went to bed early—our adventure was set to begin at 3 a.m. the next morning!

On March 16, to catch our ferry at 8AM in Key West, we needed to start from Homestead at 3AM. However, the drive to Key west in the early morning was actually not too bad as there were just a few cars along the roads, and we could just listen to our favorite podcasts. We then arrived at Key West and paid $50 (still haunting me till these days) for a whole day parking. We walked a bit to the pier and got our wristband then took off! The idea of ferry sounded very fun to us, but it actually took more than 2 hours to get to Fort Jefferson, where the visitor center of Dry Tortugas is located. We had a nice nap and woke up again when the ferry stopped at the island.

As you can see in the pictures above and below, the weather that day was absolutely perfect, which made the whole experience even more enjoyable. We started by strolling around the fort, admiring this beautiful structure that, despite never having been used in battle, was remarkably well preserved. Inside the fort, there was a green space with a few benches where people could sit and sunbathe.

After picking up a souvenir from the visitor center, we decided to have lunch before continuing our adventure. Lunch was already included with the ferry tickets and was served on the ferry itself, so the island staff wouldn’t have to deal with trash. We had sandwiches from Jimmy John’s, which were pretty good—actually, it was my first time trying them!

After lunch, we grabbed our snorkels and fins and jumped into the sea! We had a wonderful time soaking up the sun and enjoying the refreshing water. And just like on the way there, we napped all the way back to Key West.
