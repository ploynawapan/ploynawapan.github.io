title: "Hitting all national parks in FL!"
excerpt: <img src='/images/Florida/FL0.jpeg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20" loading="lazy"> We’ve been to Florida together before, but last time we stayed in Orlando and visited Disney World. Now that we've started exploring more national parks, we decided to return to Florida with the goal of visiting all three national parks in the stat, namely, Everglades, Biscayne, and Dry Tortugas. Except for Everglades, the other two are only accessible by ferry or speedboat, which gave us some unique experiences we hadn’t had anywhere else in the U.S.
