We’ve been to Florida together before, but last time we stayed in Orlando and visited Disney World. Now that we've started exploring more national parks, we decided to return to Florida with the goal of visiting all three national parks in the state: Everglades, Biscayne, and Dry Tortugas. Except for Everglades, the other two are only accessible by ferry or speedboat, which gave us some unique experiences we hadn’t had anywhere else in the U.S.

On March 15, the first day of our spring break, we began our trip by taking the Peoria bus to O’Hare and then catching a flight to Miami—a journey that took nearly the entire day. After arriving in Miami, we picked up a rental car and drove to our Airbnb in Homestead. We chose to stay in Homestead because it’s conveniently located near all the national parks we planned to visit (except for Dry Tortugas, which is in Key West). Exhausted but excited for the days ahead, we went to bed early—our adventure was set to begin at 3 a.m. the next morning!
