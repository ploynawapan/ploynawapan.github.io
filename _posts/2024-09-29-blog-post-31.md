title: "Mount Rainier and Olympic National Parks in the fall"
excerpt: <img src='/images/sea0.jpg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> After we found out that there are some flights from Willard (a regional airport in Champaign) that are inexpensive, we started flying out from here instaead of Chicago. We got a really good price of plane tickets to Seattle, so we decided to go to more national parks! The two parks that we visited were Mount Rainier and Olympic National Parks. We thought about going to North Cascade as well, but the time was limited so we planned to visit there next time. Visiting these two popular national parks in the fall was such a good choice--less crowd, nice weather, and fall foliage!
