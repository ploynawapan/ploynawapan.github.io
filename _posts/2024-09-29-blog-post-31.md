After we found out that there are some flights from Willard (a regional airport in Champaign) that are inexpensive, we started flying out from here instaead of Chicago. We got a really good price of plane tickets to Seattle, so we decided to go to more national parks! The two parks that we visited were Mount Rainier and Olympic National Parks. We thought about going to North Cascade as well, but the time was limited so we planned to visit there next time. Visiting these two popular national parks in the fall was such a good choice--less crowd, nice weather, and fall foliage!

We began our trip on September 28, although we flew out of Champaign the evening before, on the 27th, and spent most of that night traveling to Seattle. Our first adventure was a visit to Olympic National Park, which spans a vast portion of Washington. The first stop within the park was Hurricane Ridge. My fiancé hadn’t quite prepared me for the length of the hike—I initially thought it would be a short walk. Instead, it took all my strength to reach the top. Despite the challenge, the view from the summit was absolutely breathtaking, and I couldn’t help but forgive him.

Our next stop was Port Angeles, where we enjoyed a poke bowl and some ice cream. Although I didn’t include a picture here, the ocean was a strikingly vivid blue.

From there, we drove to the Hoh Rainforest, another part of Olympic National Park. The rainforest was lush and incredibly mossy. Every tree was draped in moss and ferns, transporting us back to what felt like the age of dinosaurs. (And yes, my fiancé couldn’t resist channeling his inner child by role-playing as a T-rex.)"

This version improves flow, adds vividness, and keeps your playful tone intact. Let me know if you’d like further adjustments!

Just before sunset, we arrived at our final stop of the day: Ruby Beach. Although there are many beaches along the Pacific coast, we chose this one because it was the most well-known (as indicated on Google Maps).

We instantly fell in love with the beach. The sunset painted beautiful silhouettes across the landscape, and the mist added an ethereal quality to the scene. After soaking in the magical atmosphere, we left the beach once the sun had set and headed to a supermarket to pick up some sushi and noodles, bringing a perfect day to a close.

The next day, we began our adventure at the Paradise corridor in Mount Rainier National Park. The name couldn’t have been more fitting—it truly felt like paradise on Earth.

We spent time walking around, taking in the breathtaking views of the mountains and lush surroundings. One particularly adorable moment was spotting a groundhog gazing intently at the mountain, as if it, too, was marveling at the beauty of the landscape.

Next, we visited Reflection Lake (pictured below), but the water was not completely still, so the reflection wasn’t as clear as we had hoped. We also explored the Grove of the Patriarchs, a peaceful walk along a shallow creek. The atmosphere was incredible, and we were fortunate to have the area all to ourselves at that time.

Before wrapping up the day, we decided to visit the Sunrise Corridor. While it wasn’t as striking as the Paradise Corridor, it felt quieter and brought us closer to Mount Rainier, offering a different perspective.

We then returned to Seattle, enjoyed some amazing ramen, and endured a red-eye flight back to Champaign, marking the end of our trip.
