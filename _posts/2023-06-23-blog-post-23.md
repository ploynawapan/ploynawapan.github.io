After having to postpone the Visa appointment for a year due to the pandemic situation, my parents have now got their first ever US Visa! A month right after they received their passports, now with the US Visa attached to, they flew from Thailand to the US to visit me in Illinois. To be more accurate, WE flew together from Thailand to Chicago, though on different flights. Our itinerary was to visit Chicago, Washington DC, NYC, and, of course, my beloved cornfield city, Champaign.

Okay, so let's start with the closest big city to my school, Chicago. I booked Congress plaza hotel for two nights as it was the only place available on a hotel booking website that was also affordable. Still, the price was not really that good, but it's Chicago so I just had to accept the price. However, the hotel room was pretty nice and the interior decoration of the hotel looked very much like in the Great Gasby. In fact, we took a detour on the first day to my apartment in Champaign to drop off our stuff. Then we went up to Chicago by train on the next day.
