After having to postpone the Visa appointment for a year due to the pandemic situation, my parents have now got their first ever US Visa! A month right after they received their passports, now with the US Visa attached to, they flew from Thailand to the US to visit me in Illinois. To be more accurate, WE flew together from Thailand to Chicago, though on different flights. Our itinerary was to visit Chicago, Washington DC, NYC, and, of course, my beloved cornfield city, Champaign. (That's why I put a picture of my dad and I with Foellinger auditorium in the thumbnail.)

Okay, so let's start with the closest big city to my school, Chicago. I booked Congress plaza hotel for two nights as it was the only place available on a hotel booking website that was also affordable. Still, the price was not really that good, but it's Chicago so I just had to accept the price. However, the hotel room was pretty nice and the interior decoration of the hotel looked very much like in the Great Gasby. In fact, we took a detour on the first day to my apartment in Champaign to drop off our stuff. Then we went up to Chicago by train on the next day. Since it took almost 3 hours from Champaign to Chicago, we arrived at the hotel just about the check-in time. Once we dropped off our luggage, we went straigt to *Ming Hin*, a famous dimsum place near the Milllenium park. Unfortunately, the AC was broken on that day, but the dimsum and stir fried noodle with BBQ pork were a blast! 

We didn't do anything much on the first day in Chicago except strolling around, seeing the bean and Navy Pier, and going up to *Skydeck* at Willis tower. I had been to Willis tower once prior to this time and I liked it a lot. The view up there was still amazing, especially on a (almost) sunny day like that. In the evening we grabbed Shake Shack on the first floor of Willis tower before going back to our place.

On the next day, we started with a hearty breakfast at *Wild berry*. I ordered only two things: one savory omelette and hashbrown and a deck of signature berry bliss pancakes. Both of them were super delicious but impossible to finish! After that, we went to Dusable bridge to get on the Architecture boat tour. It was my first time on a cruise in Chicago. The guide of our cruise was very active and full of energy, plus the river was so gorgeous on that day. We did get a lot of knowledge of the Chicago river; moreover, now I know why there are so many awe-inspiring buildings along the river. (Please find the answer yourself by booking a tour if you haven't known the answer already.) 

For lunch, I booked *Purple pig* just to let them try some fancy food (Just kidding, it wasn't that fancy but of high quality. I would say.) The crispy pig's ears and half duck were tasteful, but the 3-way mushrooms wasn't our favorite. In the evening, we went to *Shedd aquarium* to vist my Beluga friends, also known as beefy whales. We also remembered to get a cone of ice cream from the Original rainbow cone's truck in front of Shedd. It was worth every penny in the opinion of ice cream lover like me. We made a stop at Nordstorm racks for a bit before going back to the hotel.
