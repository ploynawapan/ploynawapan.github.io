title: "The long awaited trip in the US with my parents"
excerpt: <img src='/images/par1.JPG' width='230' height='140' align="right" hspace="20"> After having to postpone the Visa appointment for a year due to the pandemic situation, my parents have now got their first ever US Visa! A month right after they received their passports, now with the US Visa attached to, they flew from Thailand to the US to visit me in Illinois. To be more accurate, WE flew together from Thailand to Chicago, though on different flights. Our itinerary was to visit Chicago, Washington DC, NYC, and, of course, my beloved cornfield city, Champaign.
