After having to postpone the Visa appointment for a year due to the pandemic situation, my parents have now got their first ever US Visa! A month right after they received their passports, now with the US Visa attached to, they flew from Thailand to the US to visit me in Illinois. To be more accurate, WE flew together from Thailand to Chicago, though on different flights. Our itinerary was to visit Chicago, Washington DC, NYC, and, of course, my beloved corn field city, Champaign. (That's why I put a picture of my dad and I with Foellinger auditorium in the thumbnail.)

Okay, so let's start with the closest big city to my school, Chicago. I booked the Congress Plaza hotel for two nights as it was the only place available on booking.com that was affordable. Still, the price was not really that good, but it's Chicago so I just had to accept the price. However, the hotel room was pretty nice and the interior decoration of the hotel looked very much like in the Great Gasby. In fact, we took a detour on the first day to my apartment in Champaign to drop our stuff. Then we went up to Chicago by train on the day after. Since it took almost 3 hours from Champaign to Chicago, we arrived at the hotel just about the check-in time. Once we dropped off our luggage in our room, we went straigt to *Ming Hin*, a famous dimsum place near the Milllenium park. Unfortunately, the AC was broken on that day, but the dimsum and stir fried noodle with BBQ pork were a blast! 

We didn't do anything much on the first day in Chicago except strolling around, seeing the bean and Navy Pier, and going up to *Skydeck* at Willis tower. I had been to Willis tower once prior to this time and I liked it a lot. The view up there was still amazing, especially on a (almost) sunny day. In the evening we grabbed Shake Shack on the first floor of Willis tower before going back to our place.

On the next day, we started with a hearty breakfast at *Wild berry*. I ordered only two dishes: one savory omelette and hashbrown and a deck of signature berry bliss pancakes. Both of them were super delicious but impossible to finish! After that, we went to Dusable bridge to get on the Architecture boat tour. It was my first time on a cruise in Chicago. The guide of our cruise was very active and full of energy, plus the river was so gorgeous on that day. We did get a lot of architectural knowledge; moreover, now I know why there are so many awe-inspiring buildings along the river. (Please find the answer yourself by booking a tour if you haven't known the answer already.) 

For lunch, I booked *Purple pig* just to let them try some fancy food (Just kidding, it wasn't that fancy but of high quality, I would say.) The crispy pig's ears and half duck were tasteful, but the 3 way mushrooms wasn't our favorite. In the evening, we went to *Shedd aquarium* to vist my Beluga friends, which are also known as beefy whales. We also remembered to get a cone of ice cream from the Original rainbow cone's truck in front of Shedd. It was worth every penny in the opinion of an ice cream lover like me. We made a stop at Nordstorm racks to buy pairs of sun glasses for my aunties before going back to the hotel. We didn't have a full meal dinner that night as we were still quite full from the "half" duck.

In the morning, we were headed to Midway International Airport since 9 AM. We bought big city chicken at the airport as breakfast, and I  must say that I would not recommend it at all. The fried chicken was so dry and cold despite the fact that we were there in the early morning. Anyway, we flew to DC via Southwest airline. It was my first time using their service. There were no seats assigned for the passenger, but we were assigned the order in the line to get on the plane. For example, we were at B5, B6, B7, meaning that we were in group B and would be the 5th, 6th, and 7th passengers who get on the plane to select our seats. It was quite a new experience, so we named their service "flying bus." We finally arrived at the *District* hotel in Washington DC around 1 PM. The plan for today was to go to the US capitol and the national botanic garden. We had to book the timed tickets to the capitol in advance because of the high demand. We visited three rooms inside the capitol, the Crypt (the room full of roman pillars underneath the Rotunda), the Rotunda (the dome), and the Statuary rooms (where located the statue of each state's important people). We had a quick dinner at the food court in the US capitol. My dad got mac and cheese with stewed beef, and my mom got a pepperoni pizza. The food was not very flavorful but definitely filling our hunger. We walked around the US capitol a bit more and stopped at the botanic garden to take some pictures, and that concludes our first day in DC.
