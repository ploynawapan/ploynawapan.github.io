We had the chance to return to England for Poy’s graduation at Oxford University—a trip filled with celebration, friends, and family. It was such a joy to revisit familiar places and explore new ones, like Canterbury and Hampton Court Palace, which took us a bit outside the city. Accompanied by Poy’s family and my college bestie, Emma, the trip was packed with laughter, meaningful moments, and plenty of walking—over 15,000 steps a day!

To start, the photo above perfectly captures the heart of this trip. After a year and a half away, Poy finally returned to Oxford for his long-awaited graduation. The event was filled with joy, love, and a deep sense of pride—evident not only in the ceremony itself but also on the faces of proud parents we passed along the way.

We spent three days in Oxford, with the graduation ceremony taking place on the second day. On the first day, we strolled around the city, exploring its historic buildings and sculptures. One highlight was a tour of the Duke Humfrey’s Library—an ancient, dimly lit space with a wonderfully nostalgic scent of old books. We also visited several iconic spots in Oxford, including the Radcliffe Camera, the Bridge of Sighs, Christ Church, and a number of other colleges.

On the day of the graduation, my friend Emma—who’s currently studying at Imperial College and a fellow Bowdoin alum—came to Oxford to celebrate Poy’s special day with us. While Poy attended a formal reception at Lincoln College with his parents, Emma and I headed to a charming café called The Vaults and Garden, located just in front of the Radcliffe Camera. We ordered two scones, coffee, and tea, and ended up chatting for hours. Later, I returned to Lincoln to accompany Poy’s parents to the Sheldonian Theatre, where the graduation ceremony was held. The ceremony itself was impressively efficient, yet still full of charm—it truly transported everyone back to the tradition and grandeur of Oxford’s earliest graduations, centuries ago.

On June 1, we headed to London. Since our Airbnb wouldn’t be ready for check-in until late afternoon, we used Bounce to store our luggage, which allowed us to make the most of our morning. Our first stop was Buckingham Palace, where we caught a glimpse of the famous guard march. There were thousands of people gathered outside the gates, hoping to witness the Changing of the Guard. Unfortunately, the view was mostly blocked, and the overwhelming crowd made it difficult to enjoy—so we decided to move on.


Next, we made our way to the Tower of London, one of the city's most iconic historic landmarks. We booked a guided tour, which gave us access to explore inside the fortress. The Tower offered a fascinating look into England’s royal and military past. We saw displays of ancient armor and weaponry, learned about the lives of those who once lived and worked within its stone walls, and visited the infamous spots where prisoners were held—and in some cases, executed.

There was also a lovely garden near the Tower of London, so we paused to snap a quick photo—and it turned out beautifully thanks to the perfect lighting!

On June 2, we took a short trip out of town to visit one of the wonders of the world—our beloved Stonehenge. We booked the same tour we had taken two years ago, offered by Golden Tours. Although the price had gone up slightly to $70, it still felt like a great deal, as it included round-trip transportation by bus, admission to the site, and light snacks. In our opinion, it’s probably the most convenient and affordable way to visit Stonehenge if you don’t have a car.

As for the stones themselves—they were as magnificent as ever. Standing before the ancient structure always gives me goosebumps. There’s something hauntingly beautiful and awe-inspiring about the scale, symmetry, and mystery of Stonehenge that never fades, no matter how many times you visit.

In the afternoon, we took Por—Poy’s younger brother—and Poy’s dad to Emirates Stadium, the home of Arsenal Football Club. Although I’m not a big soccer fan, I still found the experience enjoyable. It was fascinating to tour the stadium, walk along the field, and see behind-the-scenes areas like the players’ changing rooms and the media rooms where press conferences are held.
