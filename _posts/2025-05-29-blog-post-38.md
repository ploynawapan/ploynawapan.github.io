We had the chance to return to England for Poyâ€™s graduation at Oxford Universityâ€”a trip filled with celebration, friends, and family. It was such a joy to revisit familiar places and explore new ones, like Canterbury and Hampton Court Palace, which took us a bit outside the city. Accompanied by Poyâ€™s family and my college bestie, Emma, the trip was packed with laughter, meaningful moments, and plenty of walkingâ€”over 15,000 steps a day!

To start, the photo above perfectly captures the heart of this trip. After a year and a half away, Poy finally returned to Oxford for his long-awaited graduation. The event was filled with joy, love, and a deep sense of prideâ€”evident not only in the ceremony itself but also on the faces of proud parents we passed along the way.

We spent three days in Oxford, with the graduation ceremony taking place on the second day. On the first day, we strolled around the city, exploring its historic buildings and sculptures. One highlight was a tour of the Duke Humfreyâ€™s Libraryâ€”an ancient, dimly lit space with a wonderfully nostalgic scent of old books. We also visited several iconic spots in Oxford, including the Radcliffe Camera, the Bridge of Sighs, Christ Church, and a number of other colleges.

After the tour, Poy and I went our separate ways so he could catch up with his friends at the lab. While he was there, I spent about an hour waiting at Blackwellâ€™s Bookstore. Itâ€™s a large store with an impressive selection of books on just about every topic you can think of. I ended up picking up a book on Alaskan cruises, which kept me thoroughly entertained the whole time. Before heading home, we made a quick stop at Knoops, a specialty chocolate drink shop, where we treated ourselves to a very smooth and creamy 54% iced chocolate.

On the day of the graduation, my friend Emmaâ€”whoâ€™s currently studying at Imperial College and a fellow Bowdoin alumâ€”came to Oxford to celebrate Poyâ€™s special day with us. While Poy attended a formal reception at Lincoln College with his parents, Emma and I headed to a charming cafÃ© called Vaults and Garden, located just in front of the Radcliffe Camera. We ordered two scones, coffee, and tea, and ended up chatting for hours. Later, I returned to Lincoln to accompany Poyâ€™s parents to the Sheldonian Theatre, where the graduation ceremony was held. The ceremony itself was impressively efficient, yet still full of charmâ€”it truly transported everyone back to the tradition and grandeur of Oxfordâ€™s earliest graduations, centuries ago.

In the evening, we were warmly treated by one of our relatives who lives in the UK. We had dinner at a Thai restaurant in downtown Oxford called Angrid Thai, followed by a couple of drinks at Wetherspoon. The drinks were a perfect way to wrap up a lovely day.

On June 1, we headed to London. Since our Airbnb wouldnâ€™t be ready for check-in until late afternoon, we used Bounce to store our luggage, which allowed us to make the most of our morning. Our first stop was Buckingham Palace, where we caught a glimpse of the famous guard march. There were thousands of people gathered outside the gates, hoping to witness the Changing of the Guard. Unfortunately, the view was mostly blocked, and the overwhelming crowd made it difficult to enjoyâ€”so we decided to move on.


Next, we made our way to the Tower of London, one of the city's most iconic historic landmarks. We booked a guided tour, which gave us access to explore inside the fortress. The Tower offered a fascinating look into Englandâ€™s royal and military past. We saw displays of ancient armor and weaponry, learned about the lives of those who once lived and worked within its stone walls, and visited the infamous spots where prisoners were heldâ€”and in some cases, executed.

There was also a lovely garden near the Tower of London, so we paused to snap a quick photoâ€”and it turned out beautifully thanks to the perfect lighting!

On June 2, we took a short trip out of town to visit one of the wonders of the worldâ€”our beloved Stonehenge. We booked the same tour we had taken two years ago, offered by Golden Tours. Although the price had gone up slightly to $70, it still felt like a great deal, as it included round-trip transportation by bus, admission to the site, and light snacks. In our opinion, itâ€™s probably the most convenient and affordable way to visit Stonehenge if you donâ€™t have a car.

As for the stones themselvesâ€”they were as magnificent as ever. Standing before the ancient structure always gives me goosebumps. Thereâ€™s something hauntingly beautiful and awe-inspiring about the scale, symmetry, and mystery of Stonehenge that never fades, no matter how many times you visit.

In the afternoon, we took Porâ€”Poyâ€™s younger brotherâ€”and Poyâ€™s dad to Emirates Stadium, the home of Arsenal Football Club. The entrance fee was around $30, and we found it to be quite worth it. The tour includes access to over ten different parts of the stadium, such as the press room, the playersâ€™ changing rooms, the special ice bath tub, the tunnel leading to the field, and the stadium itself. Although Iâ€™m not a big soccer fan, I genuinely enjoyed the experience. It was fascinating to walk along the pitch and see behind-the-scenes areas where players and the press gather. At one point, the staff joked that everyone leaves the tour as an Arsenal supporterâ€”and honestly, they might be partially right (though itâ€™ll still be tough to convince Poy and me, since neither of us watches soccer ðŸ˜‰).

On June 3, we took a bus to Canterbury. Several buses depart from Victoria Station each day, so we planned to leave early and return mid-afternoon. The journey takes about 2.5 hours, so Iâ€™d recommend bringing something to keep yourself entertained along the way.

When we arrived in Canterbury, we explored the charming town before hopping on a punting tour we booked with Canterbury Punting Co. around 11 a.m. (Thereâ€™s also Westgate Punting, which goes along a more iconic route, but that tour is only 35 minutes, whereas ours lasted 45.) After our peaceful punting experience, we grabbed lunch near the mall area, then visited Westgate Gardens and the majestic Canterbury Cathedralâ€”a UNESCO World Heritage Siteâ€”for photos.

Since no one else in our group was particularly interested in church ruins, Poy and I decided to visit St. Augustineâ€™s Abbey on our own. The entrance fee was about $12, and the site was remarkably well maintained. The ruins exude a quiet, powerful atmosphere that really moved us.

After two days of adventures outside London, we returned to the cityâ€”or at least close to it on June 4. This morning, we visited Hampton Court Palace. Since there were six of us, we opted for an Uber XL, which turned out to be cheaper than taking the train. (In fact, we ended up using Uber several times during the tripâ€”it was often comparable to public transport when splitting costs among six people.) That said, London drivers can be a bit... intense. We were startled every time our driver shouted an expletive mid-ride.

Hampton Court Palace itself was grand yet surprisingly humble. The layout is typical of European palaces, with sprawling gardens and a central fountain in the back. But the interior felt older and more subdued than places like Versailles. The rooms were less lavish, with more minimal furnishings and decor. We spent a couple of hours wandering through the palace, taking in its unique blend of history, elegance, and restraint.

In the afternoon, we visited two of Londonâ€™s cultural gems: the Natural History Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Each offers a distinct vibe. I had been to the Natural History Museum before, but the V&A was new for meâ€”and I was truly impressed by its collection. What made the experience even more meaningful was learning that both museums were part of Prince Albertâ€™s vision to showcase knowledge and beauty in London. Itâ€™s a powerful reminder of how a leaderâ€™s vision can shape a countryâ€™s cultural legacy.

We wrapped up the day with a major highlight: seeing Wicked the musicalâ€”something Iâ€™ve dreamed of doing since college! The tickets were only $25, which is a steal compared to Broadway prices. Poyâ€™s younger brother and his wife joined us, and we all had a fantastic time. The production was incredible, and I especially loved Glindaâ€”what a fun and colorful character!

Today marked our last full day in England. We planned a slower, more relaxed itinerary to give everyone a bit of a break. In the morning, we visited the British Museum, though it didnâ€™t quite resonate with Poyâ€™s family as much as we had expected. They mentioned that theyâ€™d prefer to see these cultural treasures in their original countries, which is a fair and thoughtful perspective. Still, half of us appreciated having such a comprehensive museum in one place.

For lunch, we finally ate out for the first time on this trip. Weâ€™d mostly been cooking at home to save money (and because home-cooked meals can be tastier!). This time, we tried Flat Iron, a popular and affordable steakhouse chain. We enjoyed the steaks and burgersâ€”though Iâ€™ll admit, they didnâ€™t quite live up to Texas Roadhouse (yes, Iâ€™m biased ðŸ˜„). The free ice cream at the end was a nice touch, though!

In the afternoon, our group split up. Some of us went to the National Gallery, while the rest headed to Westfield Shopping Mall. At the gallery, I got to see some of Van Goghâ€™s most iconic works againâ€”The Chair and Sunflowers. I even picked up two magnets of his paintings becauseâ€¦ why not? After our dose of art and culture, we reunited with the rest of the family for one final shopping spree at Westfield to pick up gifts for everyone back in Thailand.

And just like that, our trip to England came to an end. This journey gave me a well-rounded travel experienceâ€”museums, small towns, big cities, university life, cultural sites, royal palaces, and so much more. London truly is one of the most vibrant cities in the world. Iâ€™d recommend it to anyoneâ€”just be prepared for lots of walking!
