A few days before the graduation, my boyfriend took a flight from San Diego to Maine to be my helper during the graduation. I went to school at Bowdoin college in Maine,
so did Poy, but he hadn't really gone to Portland that often during his time at Bowdoin. So, on the second day of his visit, we went to Portland together! (Note: Portland is definitely not the capital
city of Main, but a nice city to visit.) We took a breeze bus to Portland and dropped off at the monument square. It was a nice and sunny day, luckily!
