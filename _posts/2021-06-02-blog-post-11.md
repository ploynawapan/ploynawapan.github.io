title: 'Farewell trip in Maine'
excerpt: <img src='/images/ME1.jpg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20">  After the rainy graduation, the weather had not been recovered, but our plan still went on. We were headed to John's and Margaret's to have packed lunch that we got from Bowdoin. John then took us to the airport where we rented a car for our trip. Our plan was to go to Acadia, the most-visited national park in Maine, and then go to Bar harbor. It was a little weird that Emma and I had never been to Acadia even though we had lived in Maine for 4 years. (Well, it makes sense if we deduct a year and a half that I was not in Maine.
