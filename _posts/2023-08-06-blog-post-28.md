title: "Seeing Taylor Swift from Zone 4"
excerpt: <img src='/images/Swift0.JPG' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20">  Getting Taylor Swift's Era Tour concert was highly competitive if you wasn't aware of that yet. We were trying to affordable tickets at So-Fi stadium in LA, but failed. Luckily, Taylor added a new date for unlucky fans like us, so we were able to get two 50 dollar tickets at Zone 4 of So-Fi stadium. How far were the seats from Taylor Swift? The answer is far enough that you wouldn't want to pay more than 50 dollars. Still, So-Fi is very equipped. Their huge screen around the stadium made us feel so close to the stage. 3 hours went by so fast!
