title: "Late season skiing"
excerpt: <img src='/images/galena/gal0.jpeg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20" loading="lazy"> Skiing has become one of my favorite sports since I moved to the U.S. I first learned how to ski back in prep school, and this year, we planned our very first skiing trip together. We chose Chestnut Mountain in Galena, a small town in Illinois. Surprisingly, the terrain there wasn’t as flat as most of the state. That’s where Poy had her first skiing experience—taught by me, a first-time coach! (That does sound scary.)
