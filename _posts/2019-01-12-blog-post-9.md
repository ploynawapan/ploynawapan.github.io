title: 'Khemmarat, a charming district in my hometown'
excerpt: <img src='/images/v1.png' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> After my feet touched the ground of Suwannabhumi Airport, my mom came to me and said "Let's go to Vietnam." Though I just came back from Maine, and still had not adjusted from the time difference, this trip really killed my jet lag! We planned the trip a month ahead, booked the plane tickets and three hotels for three night in Vietnam. I'd longed for a backpack trip like this with my family, and it was like dream comes true. The first day in Da Nang was quite hot, but My Khay beach was so pretty.

After my feet touched the ground of Suwannabhumi Airport, my mom came to me and said "Let's go to Vietnam." Though I just came back from Maine, and still had not adjusted from the time difference, this trip really killed my jet lag!

Have I told you that I'm not a Bangkokian girl? My hometown is actually one of the biggest provinces in the Northeast of Thailand, Ubonratchatani. 
There is not much to do in the town itself, but there are several districts that are worth a visit if you come to this province, and I recommend you go to Khemmarat (เขมราฐ)! 

Not so long after I was back from Taiwan with my grandmothers. My parents proudly presented me about their wonderful journey in Khemmarat.
Recently, the tourism in Khemmarat has been promoted tremendously. The governor has devoted some space to build a night market, and they are promoting Thai indigo cloth to be the main product in the market. 
Apart from those recently built attractions, Khemmarat has quite a long history that comes with several old temples.

The trip was only 2 days and a night. We started off by having lunch by Mekong river at Kong Paneang (กงพะเนียง). 
Ubonratchatani is known for fish dishes such as fried fish, fish spicy soup, and diced fried fish with sweet and spicy sauce. 
This restaurant did not disappoint us: the fish was fresh and tasteful and the river was tranquil.

After that, we went to Wat Pak Sang (วัดปากแซง) which is also located near by the river.
The temple was a bit chaotic contrasting with calm Mekong: lots of tourists were making merit while the villagers were diligently selling their farm products. 
To avoid the chaos inside the temple, my dad and I went to buy some baby fish and gently pour them onto the river bank.

Then, in the evening, we went to the night market (thanon-khon-duean ถนนคนเดิน). The market street was not as long as I thought, but the vibe was incredible! 
There was a Thai performance show in the middle of the market. Thai women were dancing song after song entertaining foreigners and Thais till sunset.
Meanwhile our family were seated in Pinto Anya (ปิ่นโตอัญญา), the restaurant opposite to the stage. This restaurant is famous for its food presentation. 
They served food in Thai food containers, Pinto. We got some Khuay Jub(กวยจั๊บ), Vietnamese style rice noodle with pork sausage, and some seasoning eggs in the pan.

How can I not be in love with this place?

Before we went home, my parents drove us to another temple called Boong Kee Lek (วัดบุ่งขี้เหล็ก.) The highlight of this temple is multiple rows of white and gold buddha statues. 
We went to pay a homage the statues. Although this place was also considered a favourite tourist attraction in that time, I did not see a crowd as in the other places we went. 
The serenity of the temple calmed us down, and that was a perfect ending of this trip.
