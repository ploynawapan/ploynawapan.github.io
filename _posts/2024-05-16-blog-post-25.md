title: "National parks trip with Doctor (of science) Poy"
excerpt: <img src='/images/big0.JPG' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> Although Poy graduated from the Scripps-Oxford joint Ph.D. program in Biochemistry for half a year and already started working at UIUC as a post-doctoral researcher, his graduation ceremony was held way later in May 2024. His family also came from Thailand to attend his graduation ceremony in San Diego. We then spent over a week afterward traveling around the west coast, including, California, Arizona, and Nevada. It was my first time (and his family's first time) doing a road trip in the west coast. We enjoyed a huge variety of natural wonders that the west coast has to offer.
