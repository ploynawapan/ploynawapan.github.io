title: "England first time!"
excerpt: <img src='/images/eng0.jpg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20">  I usually don't travel over spring breaks as they are quite short and most schools in the US have spring breaks around the same time, so everywhere is just crowded. However, this break was special because I went to visit my boyfriend in England! We hadn't seen each other for a while (aka 8 months at least), so I didn't hesitate to go there when I had a chance. Though I had been to many countries in Europe, I had never visited England. I went there for 5 days not including the flight time, but I felt like I got a very rich British experience thanks to Poy.

I usually don't travel over spring breaks as they are quite short and most schools in the US have spring breaks around the same time, so everywhere is just crowded. However, this break was special because I went to visit my boyfriend in England! We hadn't seen each other for a while (aka 8 months at least), so I didn't hesitate to go there when I had a chance. Though I had been to many countries in Europe, I had never visited England. I went there for 5 days not including the flight time, but I felt like I got a very rich British experience thanks to Poy. 

I flew from O'hare to JFK anf then to heathrow on Friday 11th. It took me long enough to go from Champaign to O'Hare and even longer from JFK to Heathrow. I didn't realize how far apart we were until I got on the flight. Luckily, it was a redeye flight. I slept through the 12 hours flight from NYC to London. I arrived at Heathrow around 7 PM.
