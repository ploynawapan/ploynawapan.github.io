title: "England first time!"
excerpt: <img src='/images/eng0.jpg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20">  I usually don't travel over spring breaks as they are quite short and most schools in the US have spring breaks around the same time, so everywhere is just crowded. However, this break was special because I went to visit my boyfriend in England! We hadn't seen each other for a while (aka 8 months at least), so I didn't hesitate to go there when I had a chance. Though I had been to many countries in Europe, I had never visited England. I went there for 5 days not including the flight time, but I felt like I got a very rich British experience thanks to Poy.

I usually don't travel over spring breaks as they are quite short and most schools in the US have spring breaks around the same time, so everywhere is just crowded. However, this break was special because I went to visit my boyfriend in England! We hadn't seen each other for a while (aka 8 months at least), so I didn't hesitate to go there when I had a chance. Though I had been to many countries in Europe, I had never visited England. I went there for 5 days not including the flight time, but I felt like I got a very rich British experience thanks to Poy. 

I flew from O'hare to JFK anf then to heathrow on Friday 11th. It took me long enough to go from Champaign to O'Hare and even longer from JFK to Heathrow. I didn't realize how far apart we were until I got on the flight. Luckily, it was a redeye flight. I slept through the 12 hours flight from NYC to London. I arrived at Heathrow around 7 AM. I then took a train to Paddington station in the heart of London to meet Poy. We didn't do anything much on the first day except strolling around in Oxford and having dinner with Poy's friends at Al Pasedo, a fine spanish restaurant.

The next day, Poy gave me a tour around Oxford. We basically went to almost all famous colleges in the area and all important landmarks, such as, bridge of sign, Radcliff camera, the divinity school, Magdelen college, and Christ church. Since Poy is a Potterhead-ish, the places we went to are all related to Harry Potter. (Christ church's stairs and dining hall were used to film Harry Potter 1.) At lunch, Poy took me to the dining hall of Lincoln college, which is his college. We had fried chicken, chips, and peas, and a red velvet cheesecake for dessert. All of these only costed 4 pounds! In the afternoon, we went shopping at Westgate mall, and Poy got his new favorite sweater from H&M. At night, Poy took me to a bar that his friends recommended, Rusty Bicycle. We were so in love with their options of alcohol and the chicken wings we ordered!
