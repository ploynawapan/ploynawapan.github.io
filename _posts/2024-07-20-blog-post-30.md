title: "Mammoth Cave National Park, KY"
excerpt: <img src='/images/mam0.JPG' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> Midwest surprisingly offers us many national parks to visit all year round. One of the national parks near Illinois is the Mammoth Cave National Park in Cave City, Kentucky. We rented a car from Champaign and drove around 5 hours, excluding small stops in Indiana. We had never been to Kentucky before, and we believe that not many international students had been there. Plus, this was the first time we visited a cave in the US, and we start with the world's longest known cave system!
