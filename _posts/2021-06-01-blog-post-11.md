title: 'Farewell trip in Maine'
excerpt: <img src='/images/ME1.jpg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20">  After the rainy graduation, the weather had not been recovered, but our plan still went on. We were headed to John's and Margaret's to have packed lunch that we got from Bowdoin. John then took us to the airport where we rented a car for our trip. Our plan was to go to Acadia, the most-visited national park in Maine, and then go to downtown Bar Harbor. It was a little weird that Emma and I had never been to Acadia even though we had lived in Maine for 4 years. (Well, it makes sense if we deduct a year and a half that I was not in Maine.

We got the car in the late afternoon, so we decided that we would have dinner in Portland first. We went to a Korean restaurant named N-to-Tail. We ordered korean fried chickens and bibimbub and they were very flavourful! After that, we went to Bangor, which was not an interesting spot. However, since it was close to Portland, we decided to stay there for a night at the hotel Super 8.

In the morning, we drove up to Acadia using about 2 hours. Since we booked a time slot to enter mount Cadillac at 9AM. We didn't hike up mount Cadillac because of the weather, but it was a really nice view upthere. After taking a bunch of pictures, we then went around the Park Loop road which stops at beautiful sight-seeing spots, namely, the sand beach, the thunder hole, and Jordan Pond. The thuder hole was named after the sound of the wave hitting the shore very loudly. We finished around drive around the park around 1 in the afternoon. We weren't hungry that much, so we decided to stop at more spot-- the Bass Harbor head lighthouse. To be honest, it was an old lovely lighthouse, but it was not as gorgeous as the one in Portland.

After visiting the lighthouse, we finally got a bit hungry and went to have lunch in the downtown Bar Harbor at a restaurant named A Pony and a Dog (pretty weird name, huh?). We had (16) buffalo wings, fish and chips, and clam chowders! Well, chowders are served at pretty much every restaurant in Bar Harbor. The weather in the late afternoon did not quite cooperate, so we were headed to the Anchorage hotel right after that. We spent 2 hours watching the hunger games 2 until we got hungry again. (What a life :P) For the dinner, we ordered takeouts from Chinese Joy, a Chinese restaurant in the downtown. We also had a cup of icecream while waiting for the takeouts. (Not the one in the picture. That one we had on the day after!)

In the last morning of our stay in Bar Harbor, we started off our day at Cafe This Way. The line was surprisingly long, especially on a rainy day. The restaurant served coffee for those who are lining up which is pretty nice of them! When we got out table, we ordered two benedict eggs and a blueberry pancake. The food was really good and fully energized us.

We then took a walk in the downtown and headed to the bar island. One special thing about the bar island is that when the tide is low, people can walk to the island and enjoy the animals on the island. We also walked to the island, but, by the time we went back, the tide was getiing higher and we had to take off our shoes to walk. After we enjoyed a little walk to the bar island, we went back to downtown to have some icecream and buy some souvenirs. We got Maine blueberry tea for John and Margaret, and I got one for myself as well.

On the way back to Brunswick where we stored our luggage, we made another stop at the Giant's stairs in the Bailey island. Thught I had been there twice, that was the first time for Emma and Poy! The stairs was amazing and terrifying as always. The big waves that kept hitting the shores made us feel so fragile, but they were also satisfying to watch. And that was the end of our trip in Maine. Although it was raining everyday, the sceneries were still incredible. I'm surely going back to Maine again!!
