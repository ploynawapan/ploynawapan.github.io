title: "It's never enough of Tokyo"
excerpt: <img src='/images/jap0.jpg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> After I moved to Illinois to start my Ph.D. at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I didn't have go to as many places as before due to all to work I was responsible for. So, when the winter break came, my friends and I decided to have to travel somewhere together, and we chose Chicago, the city that is quite close for Emma and me (but definitely not true for Net and Bonus.) We stayed in Chicago for 9 days renting an airbnb near Western train station. Just like when we traveled to NYC, we decided to buy a city pass so we didn't have to plan much each day.
