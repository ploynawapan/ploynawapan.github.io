title: "Taiwan with Two Grannies"
excerpt: <img src='/images/taiwan0.png' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> This trip happened not so long before Taiwan had to change its name to Chinese Taipei, so I would like to still call it Taiwan.

My intention is to purely recount all the good memories when I went to Taiwan with my two grannies: one of them is my mom's mom and the other is her sister.

This trip happened not so long before Taiwan had to change its name to Chinese Taipei, so I would like to still call it Taiwan. I have to confess that I know very little about the political issue that is going on between China and Taiwan, so please do not get triggered if I use any word wrong. My intention is to purely recount all the good memories when I went to Taiwan with my two grannies: one of them is my mom's mom and the other is her sister. That was actually the last trip that I had with my grandma (mom's mom). We did have a happy time while we visited Taiwan because of all the beautiful nature there.

We went to Taiwan with a tour group because taking care of two grannies by ourselves would be such a hard task if we had to do it ourselves. My grandma (on the left) was already quite old at that time and had a legs problem. Still we insisted her go with us because that would be probably the last time she could travel to somewhere outside of country. And, we were right. Her conditions got worse very quickly a year after that, and she passed away in November 2020. Anyway, the important thing is we had a good time there and she smiled a lot during the trip.

Taiwan was very rich in culture and food. We had a lot of good meals and snacks. I would recommend you to try the black tofu thing which smells quite bad but tastes good and Taiwanese milk tea which is very popular and tastes amazing. Some big meals that we had included a steam feast which had a huge steam pot in the middle of the table and a lot of steamed stuff inside. We also tried bitter cucumber juice, but that would be something I've got to warn you. No matter how long the line is, it does not mean the juice is great. (But if you want to try, it'd be surely a good tasting experience).

Taiwan is also renowned for its night markets. We went to two markets if I remember correctly.
