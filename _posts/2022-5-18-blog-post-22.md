title: "A magical week"
excerpt: <img src='/images/chi0.jpg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20">  I usually don't travel over spring breaks as they are quite short and most schools in the US have spring breaks around the same time, so everywhere is just crowded. However, this break was special because I went to visit my boyfriend in England! We hadn't seen each other for a while (aka 8 months at least), so I didn't hesitate to go there when I had a chance. Though I had been to many countries in Europe, I had never visited England. I went there for 5 days not including the flight time, but I felt like I got a very rich British experience thanks to Poy.
