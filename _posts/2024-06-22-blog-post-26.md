title: "To infinity and beyond: South Dakota and North Dakota"
excerpt: <img src='/images/SD-ND-0.JPG' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20">  We'd been thinking of visiting South Dakota to see Mount Rushmore and Badlands national park for almost a year. Then an opportunity came when one of our friends gave us a buy-one-get-one-free coupon from Delta. We did not hestitate even a bit in buying two tickets for a round trip from Chicago to Rapid City, SD. Although it was an impulsive trip, we had a lot of fun observing the wildlife in the great plains of South Dakota and North Dakota.
