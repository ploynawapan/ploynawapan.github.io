Nita, my friend from Case Western Reserve University, is an NYC lover. During spring break in my first year at Bowdoin, she invited two Mainers, Um-im and me, to spend our vacation in Manhattan, NYC. By that time, we all had been in the US for almost two full years, yet we were pretty much tourists who know some English. Yes, we were acting just like tourists, and that was a fun part of this trip!

“One benefit of being a tourist is that you don't have to know everything. If you make a mistake, just laugh it off!”

As you know, I'm not a big fan of staying in a hotel in the middle of a big city. Rather than spending 200 dollars a night, we decided to stay in a hostel which costed us $50 a night. It was quite comfortable if you don't mind sharing your room with a stranger. 

Apart from staying in a hostel, we bought the New York sightseeing pass. We chose the flex pass which allowed us to visit any 6 tourist attractions on the list. The cost was $159, so it was about 27 dollars a place which helped us save quite a lot of money! 

Since we only travelled in NYC, the order of places we've been to doesn't really matter. When you are in NYC, everywhere is, most of the time, within 30 minutes from one another. 
Thus, let me just show you where I've been to and what this asian tourist like the most about NYC! 


9/11 Memorial

The National September 11 Memorial & Museum was built to commemorate the September 11, 2001 attacks. 


Ripley's Believe It or Not
------

Another family friendly chain museum that I have been visiting a couple of times in Thailand. This chain is pretty much the same as the one I have seen in Pattaya, but it is somewhat smaller as I perceived. However, it was still fun to see weird and unbelievable stories of people around the world, such as, the tallest man, the man who had lived with cockroaches, and so much more! It could be boring for science people, but we, STEM majors, really enjoyed it! 


Gulliver's Gate
------

This is the best one of all the museums I've been in NYC. It's quite new by the time I visited, but it was not crowded. Everything is scaled down as if they have travelled through the Gulliver's gate! There are lots of models of interesting places around the world. Walking around this place made me feel like a giant! 



National Geographic Encounter: Ocean Odyssey
------

This is not an ordinary aquarium because everything in this place is projected! This is one of the most innovative exhibition I have ever seen in my life. The first couple rooms were projected with the scenery under the sea. It truly made us feel like we were under water! Every room told us different stories about the ocean such as sharks, kelps, and whales. The room that I was the most impressed of is the one where we had to sit in the complete darkness and listen to the whale's noise. The tour was not long, but it was worth it in my opinion. 



Riddle Me Out

I've never thought that I'd do something like this in NYC. It's of course cheaper to do it in Bangkok or somewhere else in Thailand. However, it turned out to be one of the most stressful yet enjoyable time events in the trip. We only had one out of 6 missions to be done, and I was so close to solve it!  



Empire State Building
------

That was my third time going up to 86th floor of Empire State. It was still really cold during the spring break, but we ran around enough to warm our bodies. The view was gorgeous since it wasn't too cloudy that day, but I do suggest that you should visit it in the warmer time.


China Town! 
------

No need of flex passes: It's a must for Asian students like us! I don't actually know where we had been to in China town, but all the food is amazing. There was even Asian porridge sold in the town. I bet you cannot find it anywhere else in NYC!

This article is kind of short and not so detailed, but I hope you get some idea about where to go and where to eat! Enjoy :)
