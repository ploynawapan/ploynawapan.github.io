There are not many national parks that are ideal to visit in winter, except for those in the desert. 
For this Christmas trip, we chose three desert national parks, namely, Petrified Forest, Saguaro, and Joshua Tree. 
In addition to these, we also stopped by some of the most iconic landmarks in Arizona’s desert landscape, including Horseshoe Bend and Monument Valley. It was a dry, sandy, and breathtaking Christmas; one that turned out to be truly memorable for both of us.
