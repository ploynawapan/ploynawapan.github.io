What would you think of if you heard the name Salem? Witches? Haunted? or Tourists trap? Let me show you what kind of experience I had there!

Before I went to New Hampshire to be a TA for Thai Scholars summer camp, I got a few days off and had nothing to do. My friend, Purim, and I decided to go to Boston to visit our friends in Boston college. For some reasons, we got so bored and searched for interesting places to go in Massachusetts, and Purim shouted with excitement, "Salem, let's go to Salem!" 
Without hesitation, we booked a ticket to Salem and rent a house through Airbnb. It costed us around a hundred dollars for both the house and the roundtrip ticket per person.

By the time we arrived in Salem, it was around 4 PM, and the summer sun was getting low. We decided to throw all the bags in the house and started the journey before sunset! 
The entire town is full of witch statues and dolls. Some were like those pointy-nose witched you have seen in the movies, other were like fairies.

This town is more like a tourist spot for American people around MA as we barely saw other asians. That night we didn’t just go to bed because we were in Salem! We should befriend the darkness, right? Thus, we went for a night tour at 8 PM. There was still some light out, so it was not completely scarily dark. The guide’s storytelling was so amazing that everything seemed REAL! 

> “The guy told me sometimes he saw a headless ghost through that window...”

She kept pointing the old, ruined and dusted buildings. She told us which building was used for caging suspected people. To be honest, it was not scary at all, but the story was so much fun and exciting. If you ever get bored in Salem at night, please consider this option!

On the next day, we went to a random breakfast place. Funny that one of the waiters seemed surprised to see these four asians in town. After we were fully charged, we went to see the area outside downtown. There are some places not quite relating to the witches, but it’s quite costly, so we decided to just walk pass by. However, on the way back to downtown, we spotted a light house near by the beautiful sea area. That seems to be a good ending of the trip, but we forgot that we forgot to do something important! Yep, we forgot to visit some of the witch museums!
To be honest, we did not know which one is the best witch museum, so we just walked into the most scary-looking one. Inside, there was not much to do. There was no exhibition, instead we were seated in the middle of the dark room, still. Then, the show began. A spotlight went to each corner of the room, showing some scary scenes made of wax. It was short but quite worth it. Since the train to Boston was not there till in the afternoon, we decided to go to the Peabody Museum of Art, which has nothing to do with the theme of this town. 
All in all, this town was great for a short visit. A day or two should be enough. Although many stories of this town cannot be confirmed to be true, I really like how they wickedly used their dull history for boosting their economy.
