At the end of the spring semester, I attended a number theory conference in Dallas for a week. After the conference, my fiancé flew in to pick me up, and we took a  trip to Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas! We hadn’t originally planned it, but once we realized how close Dallas was to the park, we decided to go for it. Without the conference, we probably would never have considered visiting Arkansas, given its distance and how far it is from other national parks. We really enjoyed the thermal baths there and hope to return someday!

To start, I should mention that everything we did happened in just one day, not including the drive to and from Dallas. This means it’s totally possible to visit this national park over a weekend if you’re interested! I’ve started with a photo of myself by the national park sign, which, as you can see, is located in a small town—quite different from the remote settings of many other national parks.

In fact, the visitor center is located in one of the historic bathhouses right on the main street. The town was very generous with parking—we found a free spot in a four-story parking garage just a five-minute walk from Bathhouse Row. Below are some photos of the main bathhouses (there are a few more, but this gives you the general idea). The Fordyce Bathhouse is home to both the visitor center and the museum, making it a great starting point for exploring the area.

The building has four stories, including a basement level. Inside, they’ve preserved the old bathrooms, changing rooms, spas, saunas, and even some fascinating old medical equipment—the kind of tools you’ve probably never seen before. The top floor houses the old gym, where all the exercise equipment is made of wood and has a distinctly vintage, almost museum-like feel. It was really interesting to see how people approached health and wellness back then!

After visiting the museum, we headed to the Quapaw Bathhouse, where we spent two relaxing hours enjoying a thermal bath. The last time I experienced something like this was in Budapest, so this visit felt especially meaningful and nostalgic. We both absolutely enjoyed our time there, and they even offered complimentary cold water to help cool down between soaks. The price was $30 per person, which is quite a bit more expensive than the baths in Budapest, but still reasonable considering it’s in the U.S.

After washing ourselves, we went to a thermal water fountain outside and tried their water. We didn't dislike it, but it seems like people in the town just love driking the water. We have seen more than 3 families filling up a dozen of empty bottles and carrying the filled one back to their cars!
