title: "A unique thermal bath experience in Arkansas"
excerpt: <img src='/images/Arkansas/AR0.jpeg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20" loading="lazy"> At the end of the spring semester, I attended a number theory conference in Dallas for a week. After the conference, my fiancé flew in to pick me up, and we took a  trip to Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas! We hadn’t originally planned it, but once we realized how close Dallas was to the park, we decided to go for it. Without the conference, we probably would never have considered visiting Arkansas, given its distance and how far it is from other national parks. We really enjoyed the thermal baths there and hope to return someday!
