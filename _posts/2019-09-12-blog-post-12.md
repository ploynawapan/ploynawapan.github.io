My friends questioned our plan, "what will we do in Tokyo for five days?" I said I don't know yet, but what I knew was that five days in Tokyo are not enough. What I thought was correct this trip is not long enough, not only because of a number of tourist attractions but also some unexpected situation. After having taken Japanese at Bowdoin for 2 years, I gained some vocabulary but not confidence to speak Japanese. Luckily, my Thai scholars friends and I decided to go to Japan together after not seeing each other for almost 2 years. In this trip, I got to use some Japanese to order food and to ask the way, and, even better, to help(?) my ill friend in the hospital.

Before I talk about all the food and tourist attractions, let me talk about what my ill friend, Emma, and I experienced. Emma is my college mate, and she is able to speak Japanese at the same level as I. She suspected herself to have Dengue fever because of the rash and weariness. Before she went on this trip, she did the blood check, and it was negative. Although things cannot be 100% guaranteed, she decided to go on a trip (with out any travel insurance, oh my goodness!)

Here is what happened on the second day of the trip. She woke up with tiredness all over her body and decided to stay at home. We went to some places in the morning and came back to see her at noon. She was a little better by that time, but everyone back home, including my parents, was so worried. I decided to stay with her in the afternoon and  brought her to the hospital. However, being sick in Japan was not something easy to be dealt with. We knew that there was a free translator service for health and medicare, but no one in the house has a callable phone. Emma and I then walked to the nearest pharmacy and tried to explain them what happened. Luckily they have something called pocketalk that can translate what we say in another language. By using our limited Japanese and that tool, we finally were suggested to go to Eiju hospital which is 2 blocks away.

At Eiju hospital, we gave a staff the sheet of paper that the pharmacist wrote in Japanese. She understood what happened and tried her best to communicate with the doctor there. Another staff was asking us for the details in Japanese, and we could answer a bit but not detailed enough. He then called the free translating service, so we could communicate much easily. 2 hours passed, the staffs came back to us and said that there was no doctor that was able to do the blood check and knows about Dengue fever at that hospital. They, without any charge, kindly referred us to a bigger hospital that has an infectious doctor. There, some staffs can communicate in English and the doctor we met was good at English. After all, the doctor suggested us not to do the blood check because she does not have any insurance. He confirmed with us again and again that my friend was fine and the fever was not because of Dengue virus. However, the hospital still charged us 10000 yen, which is not bad if this cost made everyone relieve. 

Okay that's what all I want to say about the experience in Japanese hospitals. Let's talk about other places we went!
