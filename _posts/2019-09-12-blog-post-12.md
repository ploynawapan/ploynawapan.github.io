title: 'It's never enough of Tokyo'
excerpt: <img src='/images/v1.png' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> After my feet touched the ground of Suwannabhumi Airport, my mom came to me and said "Let's go to Vietnam." Though I just came back from Maine, and still had not adjusted from the time difference, this trip really killed my jet lag! We planned the trip a month ahead, booked the plane tickets and three hotels for three night in Vietnam. I'd longed for a backpack trip like this with my family, and it was like dream comes true. The first day in Da Nang was quite hot, but My Khay beach was so pretty.
