Switzerland has been my mom's dream destination for so long, and, all of sudden, the dream came true. Thanks to my dad who also has a dream to travel the world, he brought us to one of the most serene country in the world. However, Switzerland is just one of our destinations in this trip. We also went to France and Italy whose beauty is second to none!

This trip is probably the longest one we've ever had, so I'll just show you where I've been to and how I feel towards those places. I'd say that most of the places we visited are considered tourist traps, but I genuinely never feel bad to follow the mainstream. I always think that popular places deserved to be popular for a reason, so just enjoy them!

France 
---

Our plane landed in Paris, France. By the time we arrived, it was around 10 AM, and we all were exhausted already. Though we didn't get to sleep that much on the plane, the romantic atmosphere of Paris kept our eyes wide open. The city was beyond beautiful especially under the blue sky in the summer time. Our first destination is, of course, Eiffel Tower, the symbol of Paris. This tower was not considered to be a favourite landmark for Parisian when it was done, but nowadays people absolutely feel in love with this metal structure, so do I!

Apart from Eiffel tower, we also went to Arc de Triomphe, which is located in the middle of Place Charles de Gualle. Then, we were wandering along the Champs-Elysees street. To get the sense of being celebrities, we decided to visit one of the coffee stall. My mom and my dad ordered some food also, and the portion was so huge that we could not finish it. I'd say that was the first time my parents experienced European food portion. This experience will definitely prepare them for having American portion!

After that, we got on Seine river cruise. My father tried to get the best shot of me with  Eiffel tower, but it didn't go that well. Anyway, we really enjoyed seeing the houses along the river and people walking and jumping into the water. 


On the second day, we went to Louvre Museum, the biggest museum in France. One of the highlights in this museum is the most famous painting of Leonardo Davinci, Monalisa. Same as Eiffel tower, the pyramidal dome, which is the symbol of the museum, did not impress Parisian when it was first designed. Its shape contrasted with the old buildings around it, but, in the present, its weird shape attracts people around the world and makes tons of money every year.

On the same day, we went to Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris. When we saw the line in front of the cathedral, we did not want to go inside at all. Still, we decided to line up because this cathedral is one of the most famous landmark in Paris, and it would be a shame if we just walked passed by. It was pretty crowded inside but totally worth it because of several gorgeous sculptures inside. 

Just to mark the calendar, on 15 April 2019, which is around half a year since we've been to the cathedral, there was a tragic fire broke out beneath the roof and destroyed parts of Notre-Dame. I hope its renovation will bring it back to us soon.

On the third day of our trip, we wen to Reims in the Grand Est region of northeastern France. There is not many places to visit in Reims; one of the must-visit attractions is Reims Cathedral which is very old and as important as the Notre-Dame. We also stopped by a pizza restaurant. The food was just decent, but the yellow light made the pizza look super yummy. That night we stayed in Strasbourg, the capital city of the Grand Est region. Since there was some time left in the evening, my adventurous soul dragged my parents to the downtown. We got to see Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris and place Gutenberg at night. The light beaming from the edges of those structures made this town as charming as Paris.

On the fourth day of the trip, we were headed to Colmar. This city is called the little Venice because of several creeks that runs passed through the city. We took a horse and carriage tour to enjoy the scenery of the town. The horse stopped from time to time to let us take pictures of this city.

Switzerland

In the afternoon of the same day, we crossed the border from France to Switzerland! Yes, FINALLY! 
The first stop is Schaffhausen, the capital town in the norther part of Switzerland. We visited Rhine falls, the biggest falls in Europe. The power of nature was amazing, and somehow that power broke my camera. (Lucky enough that we brought two camera! Phewww)

That night, we stayed at Jugendstil-Hotel Paxmontana. As you can see, I haven't yet reviewed any hotel, so this one must have impressed me a lot! As a matter of fact, the hotel itself is neither luxury nor well-decorated, but it is located in the middle of gorgeous Swiss mountains. We spent a whole hour in the morning to walk around and take a very deep breath to get the fresh air from this place.

Sadly, the trip needed to be moved on. We went on to see the Lion Monument in Lucerne, Switzerland. (Later, my roommate Annina who has swiss relatives also told me that she is a fan of this place. Though she thought that it was quite crowded and touristy.) Then, we went to see the Chapel bridge, which is made of wood. The bridge ages over 800 years, but it was still being used! Since we had an hour left in the town, we decided to rent a boat to ride around the lake Lucerne. I know I shouldn't brag about my dad, but that was his first time controlling a boat, and it wasn't as scary as I thought!

Our last destination in Switzerland is Titlis, Engleberg. Titlis is a mountain of the Uri Alps with  the height 3,238 metres above sea level. Since we stepped out of the bus, it felt like we were embraced by the mountains. No words could describe the beauty of it.

Italy 
---


The last country we visited in this trip is Italy. We crossed the border from Switzerland to Italy on the same day we went to Titlis. Since we travelled by convenience, we didn't try to visit Pisa leaning tower nor Colosseum. Instead, we went to the vacation town Como. We were just wandering around, buying some shoes for my brother, and having some gelato.

The last day of the trip was well spent in Milan. We first went to Sforzesco Castle. Even though we didn't get to see what's inside the castle, there are several historic sculptures around the castle area that are worth a visit. After that, we took a walk to Piazza del Duomo. It was like a dream when I arrived at the square. The ground was full of birds and there was Milan Cathedral as a background. Anyway, I ended this trip by a cone of gelato, and that was how I remember you, Italy.
