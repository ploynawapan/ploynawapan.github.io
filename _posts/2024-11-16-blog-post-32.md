title: "Four National Parks in Texas-New Mexico"
excerpt: <img src='/images/texas0.jpg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20"> Before this trip, I had never been to Texas or New Mexico. Initially, our plan was to visit only Big Bend National Park in southern Texas, near the border with Mexico. However, we stumbled upon a blog where the author mentioned that there are several other national parks not far from Big Bend. In fact, the area is home to four remarkable parks-- Big Bend, Guadalupe Mountains, Carlsbad Caverns, and White Sands. Despite their proximity, these parks are incredibly distinct from one another. We thoroughly enjoyed exploring the unique natural beauty each had to offer.

Before this trip, I had never been to Texas or New Mexico. Initially, our plan was to visit only Big Bend National Park in southern Texas, near the border with Mexico. However, we stumbled upon a blog where the author mentioned that there are several other national parks not far from Big Bend. In fact, the area is home to four remarkable parks: Big Bend, Guadalupe Mountains, Carlsbad Caverns, and White Sands. Despite their proximity, these parks are incredibly distinct from one another. We thoroughly enjoyed exploring the unique natural beauty each had to offer. (The first picture here is from White Sands National Park!)

Let’s begin with the first day of our trip, November 16, 2024. Although it was already November, the southern U.S. was still pleasantly mild. We departed from Champaign at 6 AM and arrived at Midland Airport around 9:30 AM. After picking up a rental car, we headed to our first destination, Big Bend National Park. The drive took about five hours, including a stop at Walmart to stock up on essentials like food, water (a must), and firewood.

We arrived at the park in the afternoon and made our first stop at the fossil exhibit. The outdoor exhibition was well-maintained and offered a great introduction to the area. Next, we headed to the Window Trail, which we completed in about half an hour. From there, we spent two hours driving along the Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive, soaking in the breathtaking views.

The scenic drive’s final stop was Santa Elena Canyon. We crossed the water and climbed along the Rio Grande for about an hour to take in the stunning view from the top. After descending, we encountered a herd of cattle on our way to our RV hotel, marking the end of an adventure-filled day.

Something I need to mention is our RV hotel.

On November 17, 2024, which was the second day of the trip, we aimed to visit two national parks:
