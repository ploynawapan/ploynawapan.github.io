excerpt: <img src='/images/OH/OH5.jpeg' width='230' height='170' align="right" hspace="20" loading="lazy"> Despite the polar vortex that swept through Illinois, we decided to visit Cuyahoga Valley National Park in Ohio, driving from our home in Champaign. Along the way, we got to meet some friends in Cincinnati and Akron. In fact, we didn’t stop only at Cuyahoga Valley; we also continued on to see a much bigger set of falls in upstate New York—Niagara Falls. Everything was freezing cold, but the fresh snow somehow gave the entire trip a magical atmosphere.

This year, November turned out to be unusually cold and snowy, but that didn’t stop us from carrying out our Thanksgiving weekend plan: a road trip to Niagara Falls.

On the afternoon of November 27, we picked up a rental car at Champaign Airport and began the long drive north. Since Niagara Falls was quite far, we planned several stops along the way. For the first night, we stayed in Cincinnati, Ohio, where we were excited to meet Poy’s friends the next morning.

**Cincinnati, Ohio**


On the morning of November 28, Poy and I met Ben and his wife for brunch at Cedar Café. The food was excellent. We shared a flavorful chicken and waffles dish topped generously with sweet chili sauce, along with beignets served with coffee and chocolate sauce. It was the perfect start to the day—warm, indulgent, and comforting on a cold morning.

After brunch, Ben and his wife showed us around Cincinnati. We visited the Roebling Suspension Bridge, the historic bridge that served as a model for the Brooklyn Bridge, and strolled through Findlay Market, a lively public market filled with food vendors, crafts, and local art. The city’s atmosphere reminded us a bit of Boston—historic and vibrant, but on a smaller, more relaxed scale. We had a wonderful time exploring before saying goodbye to our friends around noon.

**Cuyahoga Valley National Park**

In the afternoon, we drove to Cuyahoga Valley National Park near Akron. One of the newer national parks in the U.S., Cuyahoga is unique in that it’s nestled between urban areas rather than being remote and rugged like many others.

Our first stop was Everett Covered Bridge, a charming and historic bridge that required only a short walk. Then, we went to see Brandywine Falls, the park’s most iconic waterfall. The falls were beautiful both in shape and volume, and the snow made the scene even more striking.  We then stopped by the Boston Mill Visitor Center, located next to the railroad tracks where visitors can take a scenic train ride through the park. After picking up our usual souvenir magnet, we headed to our lodging in Akron, which served as our headquarters for the next two nights.

**Niagara Falls**


On November 29, we picked up my friend, who studies at the University of Akron, and set off for Niagara Falls. The drive from Akron to Buffalo took about four hours, and we arrived in the town of Niagara Falls around noon. For lunch, we stopped at Pho Golden. The service was a bit slow, but the food more than made up for it—the pho and bánh xèo (Vietnamese crispy pancakes) were wonderfully authentic and satisfying.

After lunch, we made our way to Niagara Falls State Park. After paying the $10 parking fee, we visited several viewpoints before deciding to do the Cave of the Winds self-guided tour (about $15 extra). Standing so close to the falls was both thrilling and humbling—the water was immense and incredibly powerful. The mist sprayed everywhere, coating nearby trees and grass in thick layers of ice and icicles. Seeing Niagara Falls in snowy conditions felt almost magical, even though the freezing temperatures made the experience extra intense.

After taking in one of the most iconic natural wonders in the United States, we stopped by Tim Hortons, the famous Canadian donut and coffee chain—noticeably cheaper than Dunkin’, and very satisfying after the cold.

In the evening, before saying goodbye to my friend, we visited The Green Dragon Inn in Akron, a local favorite bar known for its creative sandwiches and drinks. They served fun options like a bulgogi kimchi sandwich, along with craft sodas and cocktails. The place had a lively, welcoming atmosphere, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.

After another night in Akron, we drove back to Champaign the next morning. The six-hour drive was long, but every mile felt worth it. Despite the cold and snow, the trip was filled with great food, beautiful winter scenery, and memorable moments with friends—making it a Thanksgiving weekend to remember.
